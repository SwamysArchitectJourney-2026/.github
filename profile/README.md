# Swamy's Architect Journey 2026

Welcome to my **2026 Learning Journey** - a comprehensive platform for software architecture, design patterns, system design, and cloud computing.

## 🎯 What is this?

This organization contains my learning journey for 2026, organized into:

- **📚 Educational Content** - Generic, language-agnostic documentation, concepts, and learning materials
- **💻 Code Repositories** - Language-specific implementations and hands-on projects

## 📚 Educational Content

**[ArchitectJourney](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/ArchitectJourney)** - The main repository containing:
- Design patterns and principles
- System architecture concepts
- Learning paths and roadmaps
- Interview preparation materials
- Reference documentation

> **Note**: This repository contains **purely educational content** - no code implementations. All code lives in language-specific repositories below.

## 💻 Code Repositories

All code implementations are organized by language/technology:

- [Python](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Python) - Python projects and implementations
- [C#](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/CSharp) - C# and .NET projects
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/JavaScript) - JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js projects
- [Java](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Java) - Java and Spring Boot projects
- [Go](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Go) - Go projects
- [Cloud](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Cloud) - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ARM, Bicep, Pulumi)
- [AI-ML](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/AI-ML) - AI/ML implementations

## 🌟 Topics Covered

- Software Architecture
- Design Patterns
- System Design
- Cloud Computing (Azure, AWS)
- Microservices Architecture
- DevOps & CI/CD
- AI/ML Fundamentals
- Large Language Models
- Software Engineering Principles

## 📅 Year-Based Learning Journey

This organization represents my **2026 learning journey**. Each year gets its own organization to:
- Track progress and accomplishments
- Maintain clear separation of learning timelines
- Create a visible progression of skills over time

Future organizations (2027, 2028, etc.) will continue this journey.
