# SwamysArchitectJourney-2026

2026 Learning Journey: Educational content and code implementations for software architects. Design patterns, system architecture, cloud computing, and AI/ML.

## 📚 Educational Content

**ArchitectJourney** - The main repository containing:
- Design patterns and principles
- System architecture concepts
- Learning paths and roadmaps
- Interview preparation materials
- Reference documentation

> **Note**: This repository contains **purely educational content** - no code implementations. All code lives in language-specific repositories below.

## 💻 Code Repositories

All code implementations are organized by language/technology:

* 🐍 [Python](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Python) - Python projects and implementations
* 🔷 [C#](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/CSharp) - C# and .NET projects
* 📜 [JavaScript](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/JavaScript) - JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js projects
* ☕ [Java](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Java) - Java and Spring Boot projects
* 🐹 [Go](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Go) - Go projects
* ☁️ [Cloud](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Cloud) - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ARM, Bicep, Pulumi)
* 🤖 [AI-ML](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/AI-ML) - AI/ML implementations

## 📅 Year-Based Learning Journey

This organization represents my **2026 learning journey**. Each year gets its own organization to:
- Track progress and accomplishments
- Maintain clear separation of learning timelines
- Create a visible progression of skills over time

Future organizations (2027, 2028, etc.) will continue this journey.
