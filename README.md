# Swamy’s Architect Journey – Repository Governance

This document defines the **governance rules, quality standards, and expectations**
for all repositories under the **SwamysArchitectJourney-2026** GitHub organization.

It exists to **protect the architectural integrity** of this organization and to
ensure that all hosted work reflects **mastery, system-level thinking, and
production-oriented design**.

---

## 🎯 Scope of This Organization

This organization is strictly intended for:

- Architectural showcase work
- System design and engineering maturity
- Production-oriented implementations
- Reference-quality repositories
- Clearly reasoned design decisions and trade-offs

It is **not** intended for learning, experimentation, or early-stage practice.

---

## 📂 Repository Eligibility

Repositories hosted here must:

- Demonstrate architectural intent from the outset
- Be intentionally structured and curated
- Minimize drafts, experiments, and exploratory artifacts
- Reflect system-level reasoning rather than isolated techniques
- Be review-ready by design

Repositories that are still learning-focused, experimental, or exploratory
**must remain in**:

**Swamy-s-Tech-Skills-Academy-2026**

---

## 🔒 Non-Negotiable Placement Rule

> **Learning happens in the Tech Skills Academy.**  
> **Mastery is demonstrated in the Architect Journey.**

There are **no exceptions** to this rule.

---

## 🏷️ Repository Naming Conventions

All repositories should follow these conventions:

- Use **kebab-case**
- Be descriptive and system-oriented
- Avoid course-style or tutorial naming
- Include a year only when it adds architectural context

### Examples

- `system-design-in-practice`
- `distributed-order-management-system`
- `cloud-reference-architecture`
- `ml-platform-architecture`

---

## 🧱 Repository Structure Expectations

Each repository is expected to include:

- A clear `README.md` describing:
  - The problem being solved
  - Architectural goals and constraints
  - Key design decisions and trade-offs
- Logical, layered, or modular structure
- Supporting documentation (diagrams, ADR-style notes, etc.)
- Minimal exploratory or throwaway content

Clarity and intent are mandatory.  
Elegance is preferred over excess.

---

## 🔄 Commit Discipline

Commits in this organization must be:

- Intentional and high-signal
- Descriptive of architectural changes
- Focused on system evolution rather than experimentation

### Examples

- `introduce layered service boundaries`
- `add api gateway and routing strategy`
- `document scaling trade-offs for read-heavy workloads`

Avoid:
- Noisy commit histories
- Trial-and-error commits
- Tutorial-style progression

---

## 🚫 What Does NOT Belong Here

The following must **never** be hosted in this organization:

- Learning notebooks
- Course material or tutorials
- Practice-only projects
- Exploratory experiments
- Draft or half-formed system ideas
- Resume-padding repositories

Such work belongs in the **Tech Skills Academy**.

---

## 📌 Guiding Principle

> **This organization exists to demonstrate architectural judgment.**

Every repository should answer:
- *Why is the system designed this way?*
- *What trade-offs were made, and why?*
- *How would this evolve under real constraints?*

If those answers are not clear, the repository is not ready to be here.
